## - Description:
Sender is an app for finding rock climbing routes around the world that you might want to climb. You will be able to filter to choose what routes you want to see. Sport, Trad, Boulder, etc. As well as grade, location, and more.

The app will show you climbing routes, and information about them. Then, you will decide if you want to add it to your todo by swiping right, decline it by swiping left, or if you've previously climbed it you can swipe up to add it to your *Send Stack* (A fancy name for a tick list that pays homage to an app idea me and [Jack](https://github.com/johnwhh) had a while ago).

## - Motivation:
The goal for this app is for me to complete a full stack project. And build an app to distribute to my friends!

- Finally have something on my resume
